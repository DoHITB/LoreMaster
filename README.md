# LoreMaster
Simple app to have your lore, with some extra features!

# How to use it
Really easy. There is no strict way to use it, but here are a few tips.

1. Write any text you want, as your history goes on, or maybe you already have some history done - just copy/paste it!
2. If you want to create an anchor (that means, a link-like element that will pop-up a text), just select it, then click "Roll it!"
3. You can use similar behaviour with "Bold" and "Italic" buttons.
4. If you know a bit of HTML, you can easily perform your own tags, or simply ask it to me and I will add it to the javascript.
5. Want to save it for later? Press "Export" and a version of the web will be downloaded. You can use that version later (will have a timestamp on the name so will keep track of your files!)

# Things to come

Just tell me your opinion, suggestions, comments, ... you have my email on my bio so don't hestiate on writting me an email, or make some git actions on my project (but I'm not very fluent on this so, be patient).
